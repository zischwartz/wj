For my final (aka thesis) project at ITP, I redid an earlier project, Written World, which came out of Clay Shirky's Designing Converstational Spaces class. The final product is live and online at writtenworld.org.

A communal free-form text world, overlaid on a street map of the user's physical location. It incorporates elements of online chat and graffiti to explore and create a bridge between the physical and virtual.
Actual discussion of what I did, why, and how, to follow.

For Clay Shirky's class, we built an experiment, based on Andrew Badr's yourworldoftext.com.

We placed a free-form text canvas on top of Google maps and added geolocation to see what happens when we combined online chat with the pre-existing relationships that are inherent to physical location and real-world places.

Initially, we only allowed New York. We've removed that restriction, but haven't really been promoting it, so the rest of the world is pretty blank.

The Future
I'm rewriting this project from scratch for my ITP masters thesis. I'll be adding features like zooming, location search, subworlds, and realtime cursors.

The original project was written in python using django, and a whole lot of javascript. My new version will be all javascript, as I'll be sampling this nodejs koolaid. It also won't use google maps, because I'm worried about their quotas, and being closed source, it's difficult to debug.
