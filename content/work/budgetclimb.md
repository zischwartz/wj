Created using [openframeworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/), the [Microsoft Kinect](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Kinect) and [OpenNI](http://www.openni.org/) _Budget Climb_ is a physically interactive data environment where users can explore 26 years of federal spending - giving us a unique perspective on how our government spends our money. In order to explore the data users must exert physical effort, revealing how the budget is distributed in a novel and tangible way.

Originally, a project for the 3D Sensing and Visualization class at ITP, [Fred Truman](http://fredtruman.com/) and [Frankie Cheung](http://github.com/frankiech) and I also entered it in the [datavischallenge](http://datavizchallenge.org), where we were awarded third place and a cash prize.
