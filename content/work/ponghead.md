sum: Play pong with your opponent's head. And your body.

For Dano's Computational Cameras class (using skills from 3DSAV class), I built a version of the game [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), where the users control the paddles with their bodies, and the loser's head becomes the ball.

I used a Kinect, Openframeworks, and OpenNi to track the users. The code for the game itself is super simple, with no win conditions, and the ball speed starts fairly slow (though it gets pretty dang fast).

I seem to have lost the source code for this, sadly, but I'm planning on recreating it with javascript in the browser.
