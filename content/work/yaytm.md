<p>Over the weekend my <a href="http://yaytm.com"> YayTM</a> got posted to <a href="http://hackaday.com/2011/01/21/dance-for-a-dollar-with-the-yaytm/">Hackaday</a>. Very cool except I'd failed to post documentation or source code, and the comments on this site were broken. I was notably called a "goober" and an "immature sociopath", among other things. Getting insulted by the Internet is cool, a rite of passage even, and nothing to be taken personally or seriously, but some of the comments were totally valid. I should have documented this thing. So here we go, after the nonjump.</p>
<p>The image above is of some sketches I did trying to figure out how the dance detection would work, and how to build the acrylic box. Source code of the actual processing sketch is available <a href="http://static.zazerr.webfactional.com/zblog_site_media/drop/yaytmsource.zip">here</a>, but it's totally and completely awful code that I can't recommend reading in good conscience, but be my guest. I should have written or found some sort of scripting/events system. Next time. </p>

<p> The bill dispenser was ten dollars used on ebay and was manufactured by <a href="http://www.ict-america.com/product/dispensing_devices.asp">ICT</a>. I burned out the circuit board pretty quickly while messing around with it, but the motor continued to work, so with a little cajoling and the installation of my own LED and sensor, I was able to dispense dollar bills using an Arduino and Processing.</p>

<p> Below is a video of me using the YayTM. It was right at the end of the show (you can hear people cheering) so the bill dispenser is a little wonky and at the wrong angle, so dispensed two dollars instead of one.</p>

<p>Any other questions?</p>
