 <p>I made this data visualization of lobbying data for my ICM class. It was due yesterday at 9:30am, and I turned in a much worse version of this, because I'd wasted a bunch of time messing with a deprecated Sunlight Foundation json method. In the end, I just downloaded 200MB of lobbying data from <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets.org</a> and used the awesome, new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/"> Google Refine</a> to clean up the data before writing my Processing sketch.</p>

<p>Edit: Sam points out that I had cumulative totals, not the actual industry totals. Fixed </p>
